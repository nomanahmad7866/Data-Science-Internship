# Newyork-Taxi-Fare-Predictions

The goal of this project is to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropout locations. For better results, root-mean-squared-error or RMSE is used as evaluation matrix that measures the difference between the prediction of model and corresponding ground truth.
